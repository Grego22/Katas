<!-- Create a method sayHello/say_hello/SayHello that takes as input a name, city, and state
to welcome a person. Note that name will be an array consisting of one or more values that
should be joined together with one space betweeen each, and the length of the name array
in test cases will vary.

Example:

say_hello(['John', 'Smith'], 'Phoenix', 'Arizona') -->

<!-- My solution  -->
def say_hello(name, city, state)
  "Hello, #{name.join(' ')}! Welcome to #{city}, #{state}!"
end

<!-- Clever As Solution -->

def say_hello(name, city, state)
  "Hello, %s! Welcome to %s, %s!" % [name.join(" "), city, state]
end
