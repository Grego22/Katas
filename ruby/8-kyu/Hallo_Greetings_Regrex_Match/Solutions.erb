# <!-- You received a whatsup message from an unknown number. Could it be from that girl/boy with a foreign accent you met yesterday evening?
#
# Write a simple regex to check if the string contains the word hallo in different languages.
#
# These are the languages of the possible people you met the night before:
#
# hello - english
# ciao - italian
# salut - french
# hallo - german
# hola - spanish
# ahoj - czech republic
# czesc - polish
# By the way, how cool is the czech republic hallo!!
#
# PS. you can assume the input is a string. PPS. to keep this a beginner exercise you don't need to check if the greeting is a subset of word ('Hallowen' can pass the test)
#
# PS. regex should be case insensitive to pass the tests -->

# My Solutions
def validate_hello(greetings)
  greetings.downcase.match(/hello|ciao|salut|hallo|hola|ahoj|czesc/) != nil
end

# Other Solutions

def validate_hello(greetings)
  /hello|ciao|salut|hallo|hola|ahoj|czesc/i === greetings
end

def validate_hello(greetings)
  greetings =~ /(hello|ciao|salut|hallo|hola|ahoj|czesc)/i ? true : false
end


def validate_hello(greetings)
  %w{hello ciao salut hallo hola ahoj czesc}
    .map{|word| greetings.downcase.include? word}
    .include? true
end
