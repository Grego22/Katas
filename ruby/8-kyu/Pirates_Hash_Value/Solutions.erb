# Welcome to the seven seas.
#
# You are the captain of a pirate ship.
#
# You are in battle against the royal navy.
#
# You have cannons at the ready.... or are they?
#
# Your task is to check if the gunners are loaded and ready, if they are: Fire!
#
# If they aren't ready: Shiver me timbers!
#
# Your gunners for each test case are 4 or less.
#
# When you check if they are ready their answers are in a dictionary and will either be: aye or nay
